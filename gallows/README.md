This project is to demonstrate my knowledge of Object Oriented Programming Language in Ruby, building a gallows game on the command line where player can play and the gallows is displayed in between turns.

# About the Game - Gallows <a name = "about"></a>

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game))
Gallows (Hangman)  is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.

# Class Definitions <a name = "cd"></a>

### **Game file**:
In Game file initializes the **_ResultPrinter class_** , **_WordReader class_** and the **_Gallows class_**.

### **_ResultPrinter Class_**:
Will interact with the game class to read the state of the game and display it.

### **_WordReader Class_**:
Will read words from the file and select one of them as the hidden word

### **_Gallows Class_**:
This class will be responsible for the logic of the game.
